# Python Environment Dockerfile Optimizations

This README documents the changes made to the Dockerfile in this directory.

## Changes Applied

1. **Updated Commit Tracking:** The `COMMIT-TRACKING` header UUID and description were updated to reflect the current optimization work.

2. **Platform Enforcement:** The Dockerfile already contained the correct platform enforcement with `ARG TARGETPLATFORM=linux/arm64` and `FROM --platform=$TARGETPLATFORM ${BASE_IMAGE}`.

3. **Base Image Default:** The Dockerfile already included a default value for BASE_IMAGE (`kairin/001:jetc-nvidia-pytorch-25.03-py3-igpu`), ensuring the build can proceed without external variable requirements.

4. **Python Environment Configuration:** The Dockerfile maintains comprehensive environment variable configuration for Python development, ensuring consistent behavior across builds.
